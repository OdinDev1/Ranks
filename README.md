# Ranks

Hi friends;

This plugin isn't anything amazing, nor is it intended for public use. I just put it on here incase of wanting to show off to other people 
I know. This code is pretty sloppy and messy as I don't expect people to go digging through the src. 

This plugin is simply a rank plugin for Minecraft: Java Edition. The plugin isn't sophisticated; it stores the players in the "ranks" folder created upon first plugin load. Within the folder, you'll find the UUID of the player and opening/editing it will allow you to change their rank.
